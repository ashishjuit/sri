====================
Shri Ramjidas Institute
====================

Welcome to the Cyborg Institute! The "Institute," somewhat in-jest, has
been an attempt at building an *ad hoc* virtual think tank in the
tradition of :term:`free software`. The Cyborg Institute has always
addressed issues at the intersection of technology, society/culture,
and the individual user.

Currently, the Institute operates as a publishing/hosting umbrella and
as a home for several projects and tools. For more extensive
information about the current projects, their state, and their goals
see the ":doc:`projects`" page. To join an existing Institute project
or contribute to an existing project, see the ":doc:`meta`" page. And
always feel free to be in :doc:`contact <contact>`."
